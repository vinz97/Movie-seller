# Movie seller
This project was made in collaboration with @PhilipTamb for the course "Distributed Systems and Big Data" @ University of Catania. <br />
It's a distributed system composed by 3 microservices (payment, order and movie) which aim is searching and buying movies usingg a credit internal system (not yet implemented). <br />
The develop of the code was done with IntelliJ and, in particular, with Spring Boot & Maven plugin. The searching movie service was implemented thanks to the [OMDb APi](http://www.omdbapi.com/). <br />
The project was also containerized using Docker and then Kubernetes was used for orchestrate the containers. <br />
